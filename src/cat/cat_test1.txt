Set goals that are in line with your life purpose



All your life goals 
 	(such as family, wellness, career, personal development and so on) 
	need to be cohesive and support each other for long-term benefits.

Goal-setting is an important process.  Set SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound).  If you prefer another method or framework, then go for it.
