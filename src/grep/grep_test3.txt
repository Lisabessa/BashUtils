CAREER
Make a preliminary career decision and create a plan of action. 
Now that you have an idea of who you are and 
where you might find a satisfying career, 
how do you start taking action to get there? 

Some people talk to family, friends, or instructors in their chosen disciplines. 
Others have mentors in their lives with whom to discuss this decision. 

Your college has career counselors and academic advisers who can help you with both career 
decision-making and the educational planning process. 

But be advised: Youâ€™ll get the most from sessions with your counselor if you have done some work on your own.
